Flow onNodesChange, onEdgesChange and onConnect needs to invoke 
requestSaveDiagram(), a function that makes a request to the 
'diagram/post' endpoint, where a processSaveDiagram() function
will be invoked. This function will save the diagram to the
database.

This error appears when the blank node edit button is clicked 
(opens modal with text area):

"Warning: ForwardRef(TextareaAutosize) contains 
a textarea with both value and defaultValue props. 
Textarea elements must be either controlled or 
uncontrolled (specify either the value prop, or the 
defaultValue prop, but not both). Decide between 
using a controlled or uncontrolled textarea and 
remove one of these props.
